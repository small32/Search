// Tabs you aren't using, put to sleep.
//
// A page open in a tab keeps its whole content process — a hundred to three
// hundred megabytes, running its timers, holding its sockets — for as long as
// the tab exists. Twenty tabs is two or three gigabytes spent on the nineteen
// nobody is looking at. So a tab left alone for half an hour gives its page
// back, and keeps what it takes to come back exactly where it was: its
// history, its scroll position, and a picture to show while the page is
// rebuilt underneath (see Tab.sleep).
//
// Some tabs never sleep, because waking them couldn't give back what they
// were doing: the one on screen, pinned tabs (those are put down by hand,
// with ⌘W), a tab playing sound, on a call, sending a download, holding its
// video out in the little window, or holding something typed and not sent.
//
// When macOS says memory is short, the half hour shrinks: to five minutes on
// a warning, to nothing when it is critical.
