"""Close Group, from a tab group's menu (Browser.closeTabGroup), in a hidden probe.

Build first, then `python3 Tests/close_group.py` from a worktree. Three pages
go into a group and one stays out; the group is closed as its menu closes
it; then one ⇧⌘T. The group and its tabs must go, the other tab stay, and
the three come back together, in their order, into a group of the same name.
Then a group of thirteen, more than the twelve steps ⇧⌘T keeps, closed with
the page on screen in it: one ⇧⌘T brings all of it back, that page in front.
